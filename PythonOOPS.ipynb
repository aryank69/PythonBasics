        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " -It structures code around objects, which bundle data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) together.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " -A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " -An object is a fundamental, self-contained unit of code that combines data and the procedures that operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " -Abstraction hides what an object does (essential features), while encapsulation hides how it does it (implementation details, bundling data/methods)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " -Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that have double underscores at both the beginning and the end of their names.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        " -It is a mechanism where a new class (child/derived class) acquires properties and behaviors from an existing class (parent/base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " -It means \"many forms,\" allowing a single interface (like a method or function) to represent different underlying actions or objects, enabling objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface while behaving uniquely.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " -Encapsulation in Python is achieved primarily through naming conventions and the use of the @property decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " -A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize the attributes (state) of an object immediately after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " -In Python, class methods are methods that are bound to the class and receive the class itself (cls) as an implicit first argument, while static methods are utility functions that belong to the class's namespace but do not receive any implicit first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " -Method overloading is an object-oriented programming concept that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " -Method overriding in OOP lets a child class redefine a method from its parent class, giving it a specific implementation while keeping the same name, parameters, and return type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " -The @property decorator in Python is a built-in feature that allows methods within a class to be accessed like attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " -It allows developers to write flexible, reusable, and maintainable code by enabling objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass or interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15.  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " -An abstract class in Python serves as a blueprint for other classes, defining a common interface and ensuring consistency across related subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " -Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) advantages include modularity, code reusability (inheritance), data security (encapsulation), flexibility (polymorphism), and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " -A class variable is shared by all instances (objects) of a class, whereas each instance variable is unique to the specific instance it belongs to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " -It allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        " -In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are \"dunder\" (double-underscore) methods used to define how an object is represented as a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        " -to grant access to methods and properties of a parent or superclass from within a child or subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " -The __del__ method in Python, also known as the destructor, defines code to be executed when an instance of a class is about to be \"destroyed\" or garbage-collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " -A @staticmethod is a method that conceptually belongs to the class but doesn't require access to the class instance (self) or the class itself (cls) as a parameter.  A @classmethod is a method that is bound to the class itself, not an instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " -In Python, polymorphism works with inheritance through method overriding and dynamic typing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " -Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming style that allows multiple methods to be called sequentially on a single object in one continuous line of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " -The purpose of the __call__ method in Python is to allow an instance of a class to be called as a function."
